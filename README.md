# Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp

Here I will implement common reinforcement learning algorithms, presumably mostly for game-playing domains, to strengthen my understanding.

The tasks will be based on the wonderful, practical [reinforcement learning course of Thomas Simonini](https://simoninithomas.github.io/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course "Deep Reinforcement Learning Course").
